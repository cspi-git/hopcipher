Encrypt/Decrypt a string with a password using multiple nodes to provide high security(Demo).

## Installation
Github:
```
git clone https://github.com/hanaui-git
```

NpmJS:
```
npm i express request-async sovrin-did shuffle-seed lodash md5
```

## Usage
Client:
```
node client.js
```

Server:
```
node server/index.js
